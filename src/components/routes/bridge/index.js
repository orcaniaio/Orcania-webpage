                    The Orcania Bridge is the first ever decentralized and

                    instant and cheap transfer of assets such as tokens and
                    NFTs, and data such as smart contracts interactions across
                    multiple blockchains.

                    <br />
                    The bridge is decentralized, it is run and secured by
                    hundreds of nodes that forward its transactions and prevent
                    any cheating, it is permissionless and anyone can add their
                    assets to it and develop on it, it's flexible and allows
                    developers to link any kind of assets and smart contrats to
                    it and even utilize the bridge for custom tasks by
                    customizing the contracts they link to it, the bridge is
                    very fast and can process up to 6400 transaction per second
                    on certain blockchains, it's cheaper than most bridges for
                    it doesn't take a fee in % but only takes a fixed
                    transaction fee, and thanks to the technology of Orcania,
                    transactions on the Bridge are even cheaper than an ERC20
                    token transfer.

                    The bridge was built to be secure, decentralized,

                    operating on the blockchains it links and through hundreds
                    of validator nodes that help run and secure the bridge.

                    The bridge is run and secured by hundreds of validator nodes
                    that process its transactions and prevent any cheating. The
                    nodes take care of carrying transactions from one blockchain
                    to another, they are what manages CFR-POS consensus, blocks,
                    epochs, authenticity, and the minting and burning of tokens
                    on the blockchains through submission of validated blocks.

                    transactions are finalized on these blockchains, and thanks
                    to the Orcania Shared Processing Protocol, the bridge
                    optimizes the finalization of these transactions and

                    The Orcania Bridge is optimized for optimal performance and
                    the lowest of fees, and thanks to the bridge's Beacon Block
                    Protocol and Shared Processing Protocol aka reverse
                    congestive architecture, a transfer using the bridge costs
                    less than an ERC20 token transfer on the blockchain, making
                    the bridge very cheap even on blockchains such as Ethereum.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The transcation fee of the bridge is payed with the bridges
                    governance coin OCA (Orcania Coin), this fee is payed to
                    validator, signer and claimer nodes to cover their expenses.
                    In the case of custom contracts an extra fee might be needed
                    for claimer nodes to cover their expenses and get the
                    transaction finalized.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The reverse congestive architecture of the bridge means that
                    the more transactions that the bridge has to process, the
                    cheaper it becomes to process these transactions, thus
                    allowing users to set very low fees when the bridge usage is
                    high and their transactions would still be finalized almost
                    immediately. ======= The Orcania Bridge is optimized for
                    optimal performance and the lowest of fees, and thanks to
                    the bridge's Beacon Block Protocol and Shared Processing
                    Protocol aka reverse congestive architecture, a transfer
                    using the bridge costs less than an ERC20 token transfer on
                    the blockchain, making the bridge very cheap even on
                    blockchains such as Ethereum.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The transcation fee of the bridge is payed with the bridges
                    governance coin OCA (Orcania Coin), this fee is payed to
                    validator nodes to cover their expenses. In the case of
                    custom contracts an extra fee might be needed for
                    transactions to cover their expenses and get the transaction
                    finalized.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The reverse congestive architecture of the bridge means that
                    the more transactions that the bridge has to process, the
                    cheaper it becomes to process these transactions, thus

                Almost any device and any wifi connection can run any of the

                <br />
                However for optimal synchronization with the blockchain, a wifi

                Validator nodes are the main nodes of the bridge and manage its
                security and flow of transactions, to achieve that, validator
                nodes have to stake a minimum of 1000 OCA (1000$) to earn the
                right to submit blocks of data and to earn voting power over
                other blocks of data.
